TLL was deisgned to help users learn words and phrases in foreign languages using the technique of spaced repetiton.

# Features
Learning Environment
The process page is where the quiz is for the user to learn words in the form of multiple choice questions and written words.
After every question the correct word is displayed and the user is able to see if they got it correct or incorrect. They can also hear the word, which is done by using the Google API. The user can also use the Google API to talk using a microphone to see if they are saying the word correct.
At the end of the quiz the user is able to see their total score, the words they got correct and the words they got incorrect.
Other features that are included in the learning environment is that the words are repeated in a spaced amount of time, to help the user learn the words better. Also, in the text entry questions, if the user types a word which is similar word (same soundex) then the word which is typed will be added to the database as a possible option in the multiple choice for the correct word.

Progress Environment
On the progress environment, the user is able to see how they are progressing. They are able to see the words they are getting correct and the words that they got incorrect.
The correct words are represented by progress bars for the word. The more they get the word correct the more the progress bar increments.
The incorrect words are represented by a word cloud. The more they get the word incorrect, the word is then larger.
